# Coffee Shop Model
A simple Python implementation of a coffee shop's ordering system.

## How It Works
This model allows you to:

* Represent customers who can place orders.
* Define different coffee items with their names and prices.
* Create orders that link customers to the coffees they want to buy.
* Calculate the total price of an order.
