# Coffee Shop Model
A simple Python implementation of a coffee shop's ordering system.

## How It Works
This model allows you to:

* Represent customers who can place orders.
* Define different coffee items with their names and prices.
* Create orders that link customers to the coffees they want to buy.
* Calculate the total price of an order.

## Setup
To use this model, you need Python installed on your system.
1.  *Install (if necessary):* If there are any specific libraries required (though this basic model might not need any beyond standard Python), you can install them using pip:
    bash
    pip install .

    ## Usage (Conceptual)
You would typically use this model in a Python script or interactive session. Here's a basic idea of how you might interact with it:

```python
# Assuming your classes are in a file named coffee_shop.py
from coffee_shop import Customer, Coffee, Order

# Create a customer
alice = Customer(name="Alice")

# Define a coffee
latte = Coffee(name="Latte", price=4.50)

# Alice places an order for a latte
order1 = Order(customer=alice, coffees=[latte])

# Calculate the total price of the order
total_price = order1.calculate_total()
print(f"{alice.name}'s order total: ${total_price}")
