# Coffee Shop Model
A simple Python implementation of a coffee shop's ordering system.

## How It Works
This model allows you to:

* Represent customers who can place orders.
* Define different coffee items with their names and prices.
* Create orders that link customers to the coffees they want to buy.
* Calculate the total price of an order.

## Setup
To use this model, you need Python installed on your system.
1.  *Install (if necessary):* If there are any specific libraries required (though this basic model might not need any beyond standard Python), you can install them using pip:
    bash
    pip install .
